# Machine Learning Course Projects (2023-2024)
This repository contains a collection of projects developed during the 2023-2024 Machine Learning course. Each project explores key machine learning concepts and techniques, aiming to provide hands-on experience with various algorithms and models.

## Contents
1. Linear Regression and Model Evaluation

    Explores the fundamentals of linear regression, including error metrics like RMSE and R², to evaluate model performance.

2. Classification Algorithms

    Implements different classification techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors, focusing on model comparison and accuracy.

3. Clustering Techniques

    Applies clustering methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering, with visualizations to analyze data groupings and understand patterns.

4. Dimensionality Reduction

    Introduces techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dataset dimensionality, optimizing model efficiency without significant loss of information.

5. Neural Networks and Deep Learning Basics

    Covers the basics of neural networks, building simple architectures to understand forward and backpropagation.
